An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computer system inspired by biological neural networks for creating artificial brains based on the collection of connected units called artificial neurons. It is designed to analyse and process information as humans. Artificial Neural Network has self-learning capabilities to produce better results as more data is available.
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is composed of four principal objects:

Layers: all the learning occurs in the layers. There are 3 layers 1) Input 2) Hidden and 3) Output
Feature and label: Input data to the network (features) and output from the network (labels)
Loss function: Metric used to estimate the performance of the learning phase
Optimizer: Improve the learning by updating the knowledge in the network
A neural network will take the input data and push them into an ensemble of layers. The network needs to evaluate its performance with a loss function. The loss function gives to the network an idea of the path it needs to take before it masters the knowledge. The network needs to improve its knowledge with the help of an optimizer.

If you take a look at the figure above, you will understand the underlying mechanism.

The program takes some input values and pushes them into two fully connected layers. Imagine you have a math problem, the first thing you do is to read the corresponding chapter to solve the problem. You apply your new knowledge to solve the problem. There is a high chance you will not score very well. It is the same for a network. The first time it sees the data and makes a prediction, it will not match perfectly with the actual data.
The Artificial Neural Network Architecture consists of following components:

Layers
Activation function
Loss function
Optimizer
